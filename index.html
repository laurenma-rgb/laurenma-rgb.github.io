  <h1> Favorite Destinations </h1>
    <h3> Japan </h3>
    <p> My family visited Tokyo and Kyoto in February 2023. We spent seven days in the bustling capital of Tokyo, exploring sites like Shinjuku National Garden and eating our way through the city. I loved the convenience stores, the fresh sushi at Tsukiji market, and the gyukatsu. We also spent three days in Kyoto, the old capital, visiting historic shrines and temples, exploring the Gion district, and wandering the food stalls at Nishiki market. </p>

    <p> We spent ten days traveling around Europe in spring of 2024. Our first stop was London, the perfect blend of old European charm and modern architecture. Some of my favorite memories were roaming the food stalls at Borough Market and enjoying the scenery at Hyde Park. Next, we made our way to Amsterdam, a vibrant and unique city known for its canals, art, and architecture. I loved visiting the Rijksmuseum and all the little cheese shops. Our final destination of the trip was Paris. The Eiffel Tower was cool to see, but Versailles, Les Invalides, and the neighborhood of Montmartre were the real gems. Not to mention bakeries on every corner and all around beautiful architecture! </p>
