  <h1> Favorite Destinations </h1>
    <h3> Japan </h3>
    <p> I visited Tokyo and Kyoto in February 2023. Tokyo was a vibrant, modern city, whereas Kyoto had a more traditional, laid-back feel. Some highlights from the trip include Shinjuku National Garden, fresh sushi at Tsukiji market, convenience store runs, the Kyoto Onsens, and Kyoto's Nishiki market. </p>

    <h3> Europe: Paris, Amsterdam, London </h3>
    <p> We spent ten days traveling around Europe in spring of 2024. Our first stop was London, the perfect blend of old European charm and modern buildings. Some of my favorites include roaming the food stalls at Borough Market and enjoying the scenery at Hyde Park. </p>
